#Trista: 

This one owes a lot to koodiviidakko, and the book 
"PHP5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice", although really it's just a 
common MVC model thingy.

It's mostly just me putzing around reinventing the php web backend, 
for the purpose of a forum/gallery/web app type thing.

Regardless, New BSD License.

##Status:
Currently, I'm trying to make use of adodb_lite and sqlite3. We'll see how that goes.
